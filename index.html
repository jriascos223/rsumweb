            <br>
            <p>Riemann Sum is a method for approximating the total area underneath a curve on a graph, otherwise known as an integral. It may also be used to define the integration operation.</p>
            <p>It is generally the practice of taking the sum of the area underneath a curve through approximations with rectanges, where the goal is to get as many under the curve as possible (eventually approaching infinity, and integrating).</p>
